# Cryptology
### All submissions were completed in Latex. All parts of the packet were completed from a packet in my high school Cryptology class (included lessons and questions from a variety of sources)
- Cryptology Packet 1: Greatest Common Divisor
- Cryptology Packet 2: Modular Numbers (canonical complete residue system, canonical residue congruence)
- Cryptology Packet 3: Character Ciphers (Caesar Cipher, Affine Cipher)
- Cryptology Packet 4: Euler's Theorem
- Cryptology Packet 5: The RSA Cryptosystem (Numbers: Encoding, Decoding, Message; Algorithm)
- Cryptology Packet 6: The Euclidean Algorithm (BÃ©zout's Identity, Euclidean Algorithm, Extended Euclidean Algorithm)
